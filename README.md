## About me
```js
/**
 * IT expierience for about 6 years, I started with C / C ++.
 * Then I tried myself in Python, JavaScript (HTML + CSS), React (-native), Vue, Java, pentesting.
 * I have experience in microprocessor programming, worked with Arduino and STM32.
 * 
 * During all this time, I was firmly convinced that I love to code. Everywhere. On everything.
 * JS / React is one of the fastest growing route.
 * Everything I can think of - I can implement in React. That's why I love JS.
 * 
 * I am realy passionate about my work and I am constantly learning something new.
 * I study related to the field of development professions, such as design, testing, etc.,
 * therefore I understand how important it is to consider the capabilities of other
 * team members when writing code and can see my code from other angles.
 * 
 * Last 2 years I grown in DevOps to make developr expierience better, lovely.
