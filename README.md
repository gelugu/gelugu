## About me &#123;
I've been programming for about 4 years, I started with C / C ++. Later I tried myself in Python, JavaScript (HTML + CSS), React (-native), Vue, Java, pentesting. I have experience in microprocessor programming, worked with Arduino and STM32.

During all this time, I was firmly convinced that I love to code. Everywhere. On everything. All. JS / React is one of the fastest growing route. Everything I can think of - I can implement in React. That's why I love JS.

I am realy passionate about my work and I am constantly learning something new. I study related to the field of development professions, such as design, testing, etc., therefore I understand how important it is to consider the capabilities of other team members when writing code and can see my code from other angles.

Despite this, unfortunately, I have little experience working in a team, mostly I worked alone. I have always understood new and complex tasks with interest, I can search for information both in Russian and in English resources. Also I perceive technical literature very well.
